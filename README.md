## Why I Created Enimi?
I was much more comfortable with Next.js and wanted to create something using a trending stack, which was the MERN stack. Enimi was created on that stack to provide users with faster responses through its sleek UI. I learned a lot while creating Enimi and implemented production-ready features.
