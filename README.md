## Why I Created Enimi?
I was much more comfortable with Next.js and wanted to create something using a trending stack, which was the MERN stack. Enimi was created on that stack to provide users with faster responses through its sleek UI. I learned a lot while creating Enimi and implemented production-ready features.

## Installation

- Clone repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zeddxx/enimi.git
```
  
- Go into server directory and install its dependencies and run the server.
  
```bash
cd server && npm install && npm run dev
```

- Response from backend.

```bash
Listening at http://localhost:4000
```
  
- Go to client directory and do the same. (open another terminal)

```bash
cd client && npm install && npm run dev
```

- Response from client.

```bash
running at http://localhost:5173
```

  ## Deployment.
  deploy your instance at **render** as i found it way more simple for MERN stack.
